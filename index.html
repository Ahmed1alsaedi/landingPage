                    <h4>The starry night</h4>
                    <p>
                        Inspired by the view from his window at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole asylum in Saint-Rémy, in southern France, where the artist spent twelve months in 1889–90 seeking reprieve from his mental illnesses, The Starry Night (made in mid-June) is both an exercise in observation and a clear departure from it.</p>

                    <h4>The scream</h4>
                    <p>Munch wrote about the inspiration behind “The Scream”, describing a moment when he was walking with friends and felt a sudden wave of anxiety and existential dread. He sensed “the scream passing through nature” and captured that intense emotion in his artwork.</p>

                    <h4>The night watch</h4>
                    <p>The Night Watch depicts the captain of the guard as he leads his yellow-clad lieutenant as they round up the uniformed ranks. Only 18 of the 34 characters in the scene are portraits of actual people; the remaining figures are symbolic, such as the young girl in yellow, who is the allegorical emblem of the guard. </p>

                    <h4>A Sunday Afternoon</h4>
                    <p>Seurat painted A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye.</p>
